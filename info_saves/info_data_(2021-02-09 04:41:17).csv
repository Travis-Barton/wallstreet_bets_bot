41,comment,gmo40kc,,"Most brokers have good faith agreements where (even in a cash account), they'll let you trade instantly on the assumption the transfer you initiated will hit the account immediately. However, there's then the good faith violation, where:
Day 1: Buy security ABC
Day 2: Sell security ABC, Buy security XYZ
Day 3: Sell security XYZ, attempt to buy something else

That's a good faith violation, because the initial funds from sale of ABC haven't settled by the time you want to buy that third stock. Hence why a general rule is keep about 10% in cash or cash equivalent to prevent an accidental good faith violation. But at that point, you'd probably have graduated to a margin account to avoid this. Good faith is moreso based on settlement of stock trades, rather than bank funds.",1612849306.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfugw9/robinhood_was_calling_my_account_a_margin_account/,sirgentrification

All the stuff you see now that you think is important, like your buddy who grows, or the counterfeits, or the very active black market, none of that matters. It only exists because of the strange quasi-legal situation marijuana is in right now. HOWEVER, your conclusion isn't wrong. You are right, but you got there via the wrong reasons. All these little canadian cannabis companies will never control the market, but it won't be because your cousin Timmy didn't need to buy their stuff since he grows his own in his basement. Making cookies is pretty easy, but General Mills still exists.

He claimed that with the two added Saudi Arabia shows that did not happen this year, which pay $50 million each, they were still able to up their spending. He thinks that once it comes back that they'll be set to blow up. I think that their revenue went up somehow this year compared to last by $10 million or so and expects $60 a share by his call time in 2022.

304,comment,gmo4gnv,,"Well, theres really only two options. 

Sell or hold. 

Whichever you pick, make sure theres justification and a plan. 

I took a 100k loss on GME and AMC. I looked at all the remaining information we have, I looked at what the hedges were most likely to have done (my description in the post above) and came to the conclusion that the odds were really bad. Not impossible, but really bad for another leap.

If you believe that as well, the play would be to sell as high as possible off a catalyst (maybe tomorrow if more retail investors get roped in by the short report) and reinvest whats left to start recouping losses. There are plenty of stocks that will go up a lot while people hold GME. 

If you can‚Äôt stomach that, you can hold out for a squeeze, but you‚Äôll more likely be riding it down to 30-50, and then slowly building up over months and years as Ryan Cohen creates his vision of GME. I think he will be successful. But your money will just be sitting there waiting. I don‚Äôt personally think we will see 300+ again. Nor 200+ for a few years. 

I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but I have to go with the most logical outcome. The squeeze is just not likely anymore without a monumental shake up from an extremely influential person and I just don‚Äôt see it.

A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.

Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

Just spent 30 minutes on the line with Fidelity. Bottom line: if you have a **MARGIN** account with level 3 or 4 options approval, **THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES**.

However, you can request that they **DO NOT** lend *specific shares*, or even *all of your shares*. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.

Retirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are **NOT** being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.

Non-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be ""un-shortable."" This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.

I hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.

Edit: Fidelity customer service 800-343-3548. Don't tell them I sent you ;)

Edit 2: tighten the fucking noose on the shorts. If you're on other brokerages - call them and post the how-to for others. Major military battles have been won by attacking the enemy's supply lines. You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.

I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves.

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say

I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?

472,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",1612808588.0,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,Kwahn

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

Like many who were appalled by Robinhood's behavior in limiting GME buying at the most critical time, I made the easy decision that I'd abandon the platform in favor of a real brokerage (Fidelity for me). This morning I attempted withdrawing my funds from my Robinhood account only to experience two different errors, shown [here](https://imgur.com/a/2Ws8qcP). 

One error is about some mysterious additional verification that I need to complete, but with zero ability to initiate that, other than going to their support team. It also suggests the issue is due to the account I was attempting to withdraw to.

So, I tried withdrawing to the other one of my two linked bank accounts, only to receive an ""unexpected server error."" The error message suggests trying again later. Well, I've tried about 10 different times today and get the same message every time.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data.

477,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

482,submission,lfjy25,I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.,"I need some answers on the GME Squeeze. Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?

If you won't sell, you can at least hedge while you hold to zero.

Many of you are new to this and the vast majority here don't know how to sell anything. Since you love your $AMC, $GME and other meme stonks so much, how about writing/selling calls against them?

What does it mean to write/sell a call? You pick a strike price (not $1000, sorry). The strike price is the price you agree to part with your beloved meme stonks should the price go up bigly again (it won't). You pick the expiration date of the contract. Someone pays you a premium for this, represented as dollars per share. Right now a March 19th $100 strike call is selling for $12.80 a share, or $1,280 in premium. This lowers your cost basis as you get the premium no matter what happens.

If your meme stonk falls, the contract loses value and you can buy it back and sell another if you want. Point is, you make money if the price falls which you aren't currently doing sitting on your shares.

Now for the really smart apes here, you could use the call premium to buy a put and create what's called a collar. A $45 put for instance goes for $1,215 in March. So you would no longer lose money below $45 as you carefully diamond hand your way to oblivion. And it wouldn't cost you anything since the $1,280 call premium covers the $1,215 put cost. You'd even have enough leftover to buy your wife and her boyfriend a mediocre dinner.

Now, this only works for those of you hodling at least 100 shares and of course having a broker which will let you trade options. If you don't have that many shares, sorry. Options contracts trade in blocks of 100 shares.

This is the beauty of options - the ability to hedge your positions as well as speculate. Because if you don't hedge your funds, you might be a Melvin.",1612815157.0,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfkmcf/calling_all_bagholders_how_to_make_money_off_your/,Why_Hello_Reddit

I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",1612816881.0,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,watershoe

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now.

Only reason I am asking is bc CS owns TD Ameritrade and I don't know if that could cause any issues in the future (reeling from my Robinhood Burn, hence my concern)

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more **Major Catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

PS: Fuck **Jim ""Once a Shill Always a Shill"" Cramer**. That Indecisive, Bi-Polar Clown.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

[Dr. Gordana R. from Children's Hospital Los Angeles Presents Findings That Show Saphyr Detects Druggable Genetic Fusions in Pediatric Acute Leukemias  ...](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodStoryID=4789689684773596)

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1612818701.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/,Hanshee

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.  We've all held the bags from time to time, and it sucks, but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves.

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

517,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer
518,submission,lfpzz9,QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,"QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock. A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",1612830005.0,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,darkside_of_the_tomb

 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",1612831034.0,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,Natural_Profession_8

1. Are you offering advice on securities? Yes.
2. Is it a regular business or activity? Some of you post more than others (yes), some hardly at all (no), but none advertise themselves as investment advisors (you dont have to advertise for it to be considered a regular business but advertising yourself as an advisor would make you answer ""yes"" to this question)
3. Are you receiving payment or compensation for the advice? No (it doesn't have to be money as the form of payment for it to be considered, fake internet points don't count though)

You have to meet all 3 to be considered an investment advisor, so you dont have to put a disclaimer in your post or worry about the Feds knockin on your door if you dont. It's no different than me calling up my buddy to tell him to buy a stock. Am I offering advice? Yes. Is it a regular business or activity? No. Am I being paid or compensated? No. So I'm not considered an investment advisor. Even if I called him daily, so it would become a regular activity, I'm still not being paid so therefore does not fall under the definition of ""Investment Advisor"". And vice versa, if I call him on small occasion and one of the stocks I suggest hits big for him and he throws me some of his earnings, still doesn't fall under the definition of Investment Advisor.

Also, these posts are impersonal, meaning not directed towards any individual or his/her specific needs so that excludes you from the definition as well. Blanket posts for the general public of why YOU like a certain stock would not constitute you as an Investment Advisor. Technically, as long as you did it frequently and didn't time it around specific market events, you could charge a subscription fee for blanket advice and still not be considered as an Investment Advisor.

*side note: the ""De Minimis"" exception does allow you to have up to 5 clients in a single state, without having a place of business, without having to register with the Administrator of the State as an Investment Advisor.

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

We are now the crows on the battlefield trying to scavenge off the carcasses, the tribal spear chuckers in the forest that pick up the little pieces that are left over and try to forge them into weapons. The squeeze happens when one of the factions makes a move to shift the delicate balance of power that's been found right now. Until then they're all going to keep driving the price down to shake off the retail investors and doubling and tripling down on shorts so that the stock prices can pop the f*** off. 

The more of us that are in the game the more we're able to scavenge but unfortunately that's all we really amount to as far as deciding when the battle begins. The interesting part tho is that if the retards hold the line alllll the way to the end of the battle and don't give up any shares we might end up crumbling a whole fuck ton of the institutions because suddenly our little diamond stones and Spears and random used weapons we picked up along the way are gonna be super effective against these depleted ass super soldiers that are standing on their last legs when their fighting is all over.

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s.

Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  ‚Äúshocking rules"" ‚Äî rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

533,submission,lftq2y,I believe Qualcomm will recover,"I believe Qualcomm will recover This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

534,submission,lfttp8,FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,"FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16 Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor) 

\- A company that is resilient and continues to find a way to keep moving forward

We are now in a new console cycle. GameStop literally cannot keep up with the sales of the PS5 and it hasn't been out for six months. Yeah they closed stores. So their overhead is way lower and guess what they retained the majority of their business from those closed stores. You bring up Amazon like every other boomer. Okay they sell video games. They also sell Pet Food. Ever heard of Chewy? The 18billion dollar company started by Ryan Cohen directly competing with Amazon? The guy who now owns %13 of GameStop and is on their board? No because it wasn't on fox news. Walmart sells video games yeah... They also sell shoes. Does your wife's boyfriend buy her shoes at Walmart or from a shoe store? Right... The brand has value. They just hired Matt Francis as their new CTO. Guess where he worked? That Amazon place you're so fond of. They're going to revamp the entire company.

604,comment,gmo6wys,,"98% of stuff you read has an agenda. USUALLY it is to get eyeballs and clicks. So if a stock is hot they will make an article saying why it is the biggest shit stock out there. So all the people who have been reading popular takes will definitely click on the one negative article.

The truth is every analyst is full of shit. No one knows if a stock will go up or down in short term is unless they are the institutional investors dumping in 30 million on a Monday. 

So these analysts will be right sometimes and wrong sometimes. And when they are right they will say shit like ""I'm the guy who called the 08 crash"" completely disregarding that they predicted crashes that didn't happen every year since 95. 

So basically try to read the facts that might serve as catalysts for a stock. Short term use charts long term use fundamentals. You will be wrong a lot bc stocks are 100% irrational in the short short term. So trade your account size accordingly. Most people right now think they are good traders bc stocks are all going up. They will be at $0 by end of the year bc they are using too large position sizes for their account size.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage.

  The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB üöÄ üíé üöÄ. For everyone else:
  
  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven‚Äôt fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you‚Äôre like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don‚Äôt expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

652,submission,lfehiq,"Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside.","Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside. Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‚Äò08 ‚Äò09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He‚Äôs working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his ‚ÄúBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment‚Äù which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it‚Äôs truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ‚Äú..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn‚Äôt even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

654,submission,lff0y0,A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.,"A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

‚ÄúSO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!‚Äù

‚ÄúYEEAHHH!‚Äù -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",1612800487.0,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,ferrellhamster

656,submission,lffnz6,February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,"February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

672,comment,gmo871e,,"So at the height of this and when people were discussing DTCC limiting and upping margin/capital requirements on Twitter which in turn crippled select smaller brokerages that were relying on third party clearing houses.

A very legitimate question was posed:

https://mobile.twitter.com/KralcTrebor/status/13551725672424693

So yeah, did DTCC did this to prevent clearing from going tits up or were they doing it to indirectly kill of momentum? Don't think we'll ever get the question fully answered.

Fwiw tho I don't think GME would have kept squeezing into infinity as it was still a very much fund vs fund situation and volume didn't disappear even when select brokerages restricted.

Nor did I think it would collapse the market, though it definitely added volatility for those few days. There was so many factors coming together that made it the perfect storm.

Risks are mostly calculated using volatility or if you wanna get more advanced look into VaR or value at risk which is an equation applying statistics to stock price, look into your weekly/monthly standard deviations to determine a likely strike price that will hit whether you‚Äôre bullish or bearish.

876,comment,gmo8lnr,,"Diversification helps.  But it's more about finding a method that works well for you and the time frame you want to operate (daily, weekly, forgive small dips, or go insane watching the graphs move up and down all day).  I'm green as green can be, so I can't offer good advice, lol.  However, it's interesting talking with some of my siblings who've been in this far longer than I have.  Their take has always been ETFs and stable choices, and this takes a lot of variability and risk out of the equation.  However, it's also a path that might make 10% in a few months.  But a very high risk and time consuming path might make you 10% in a day (avg), although I'm aiming for better.  You sort of pick your poison.  My start was the later but also me losing money doing all the wrong things.  Now I've changed strategies and tools, and so far in my very, very, very brief time sitting more in the 10%+ a day spot.  Now I have to see how the plan plays out long term.  I too find myself stepping back from the hectic race and am settling on lighter daily maintenance work and sitting on a diverse 30 stocks with another 50 in the wings to trade in and out based on their performance at any given time.  The game plan is daily maintenance, and more macro trend watching that presents stock changes only every few days to a couple weeks rather than every day or trying to chase stuff several times during the day.  Ultimately, I'm looking for an experience that's fruitful but pleasant to work with.  Finding that system is the trick.  Again, I'm super new, so for me, this is all trial stuff, basically $5k-$10k in the market and see what I can do with it.  The data looks stupidly, ridiculously fruitful, but that's also mostly a benefit of the current market.  The market has been hot ever since the crash last fall, and the last few months have been nuts with a ton of stocks skyrocketing.  I mean, for some of the craziness of some of these stocks in just the last couple months, I could have turned $5k into $10 million just by simply starting at the right time on only a few stocks.  It's crazy that there's opportunity to make thousands of percent in such a short time frame.  That's just ridiculous stuff, but that's what the market's doing.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage.

  The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB üöÄ üíé üöÄ. For everyone else:
  
  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven‚Äôt fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you‚Äôre like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don‚Äôt expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

959,submission,lfehiq,"Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside.","Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside. Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‚Äò08 ‚Äò09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He‚Äôs working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his ‚ÄúBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment‚Äù which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it‚Äôs truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ‚Äú..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn‚Äôt even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

961,submission,lff0y0,A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.,"A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

‚ÄúSO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!‚Äù

‚ÄúYEEAHHH!‚Äù -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",1612800487.0,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,ferrellhamster

963,submission,lffnz6,February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,"February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change.

Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.

This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

He said my man JB is on freebase

Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge

I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe

981,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",1612808588.0,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,Kwahn

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

983,submission,lfiug0,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

984,submission,lfix74,Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options,"Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options  

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.

1. FlowAlgo[ https://flowalgo.com/](https://flowalgo.com/)
2. TitanFlow[ https://titanflow.io/](https://titanflow.io/)
3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data.

985,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

988,submission,lfjy25,I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.,"I need some answers on the GME Squeeze. Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please.

995,submission,lfla1i,Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood,"Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",1612816881.0,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,watershoe

997,submission,lflob4,The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market.

This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped.

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1612818701.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/,Hanshee

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

1020,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer
1021,submission,lfpzz9,QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,"QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock. A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",1612830005.0,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,darkside_of_the_tomb

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",1612831034.0,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,Natural_Profession_8

# Are they making good money?

EPS (TTM) is 116.69, it's actually earning A LOT OF money compared to GME (GUH). I found this stock filtering for high earning companies because of my GME shares lol.

# How do they fare against all the other bio testing stonks?

Let's see how many PCR machines they sell compared to others. IMO, it further highlights how absurdly discounted Bio-Rad is compared to other suppliers.

[These are from Thomas.net, an unbiased source talking about finding suppliers for various industries. See bio-rad on #9 top supplier. But Qiagen right above it at #8, trades at 67.29 PER \(yahoo finance\) compared to Bio-Rad's 5.18.](https://preview.redd.it/ikvfqh3njcg61.png?width=2085&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e1e7fefa729e46a16c188660aa4b669142822e)

# So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

>Three suppliers dominate the citations. They are Thermo Fisher, **Bio-Rad** (including brand MJ Research) üöÄüöÄ and Roche. The most cited models are Thermo Fisher 7x000 series, iCycler/MyIQ from **Bio-Rad** üöÄüöÄ, and LightCycler from Roche.

&#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

**$SKLZ Comparison To Upcoming US Esports Streaming Platform**

Visit their website for the love of your unborn child [https://www.skillz.com/](https://www.skillz.com/)

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

1029,submission,lfs22f,"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal.

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

1037,submission,lfugw9,Robinhood was calling my account a Margin account when I never had that enabled,"Robinhood was calling my account a Margin account when I never had that enabled I had some issues with my Robinhood to Fidelity rollover, (even as a longtime fidelity customer for Pre-tax and Roth accounts) so after spending a really really REEEEALLY long time on hold to get to the right rep at Fidelity they mentioned my account was transferred as a margin account by Robinhood, which was largely contributing to the issues. 

I have NEVER had margin enabled on my account. I didn‚Äôt trade options there, everything was pre-funded with cash from my bank account. 

They also mentioned that it was happening to a lot of other people transferring from Robinhood! Now I am not sure what benefit Robinhood is gaining from this and I am sure someone smarter than me will chime in the comments, but this feels very sketchy to me.

I decided to dive in and look at the stock more closely to identify what was going on and maybe apply it to other stock picks.

I then read this pick was terrible, things like the company is ""in dire straights"", the stock is too ""volatile"", ""over valued"", etc. Everything I read is doom and gloom and my instincts are supposedly shit.

but at the end of the day they're still an engineering company that has a history of getting it right in the long term, so I see this play as a mid to long term and getting out around $6-$7.

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19% and Market 25%

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor) 

\- A company that is resilient and continues to find a way to keep moving forward

If it pumps after the short interest data, I'll be cheering on from the sidelines. Too risky for my risk tolerance.

If you're in that situation, it then because worth the time and money to start setting up shell companies in tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, and moving your money around into those entities. But the fees and hassle of doing that isn't really worth while unless you are making 7 figures or more per year, since it will generally cost in the low six figures per year to manage all this, plus your lawyer's fees and other considerations. If you've got tens of millions and are making millions per year, it's clearly worth while, but if you're just sitting on a pile that you're going to spend, then over the lifetime of the money you're going to pay as much in annual fees as you'd just pay in taxes at the outset.

1166,comment,gmocmfl,,"You know DFV had a financial background and managed an extremely diversified portfolio right? GME was one of literally 100+ holdings. Value investing means looking at fundamentals rather than listening to a hive mind that posts memes. Fundamentals are why he bought at $3 and you bought at $300. You‚Äôre not him.

I try to approach managing my own money the same way - far less aggressively than top posts here but I don‚Äôt give a shit because I‚Äôm not going to be one trade away from bankruptcy (I know a couple WSBers in person and they were completely broke). Ultimately making money is the entire point.

The poster‚Äôs original suggestion was prudent and if you‚Äôre going to flex that you‚Äôre too much of a gambler for that advice, than you should probably actually gamble rather than just baghold and you should realize the entire reason you‚Äôre in this fucking stock in the first place is because of one prudent investor (one who is celebrated on WSB for making a shitload of $).",1612856193.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzy4/fellow_gme_bagholders_and_retard_brother_apes_the/,bubumamajuju

News and even suspected news tends to be priced in quickly. Basically once people know something as up, they will buy the associated stocks. In order to hit on something huge you essentially have to think of a trend or event that has not yet happened or not been predicted.

Or find a stock that is related to or within a sector that has been mooning, but that specific stock hasn't been snatched up yet.

1364,comment,gmod3lu,,"I‚Äôm 30 years old. I grew up with GameStop. Waited in line for midnight release of every Halo at GameStop. The new consoles have nothing to do with their success or failure though. Every retailer ran out of stock, by design, because Sony and Microsoft weren‚Äôt making enough to artificially create more demand. It didn‚Äôt matter where they were sold, they were sold out - and to be honest GameStop was mostly only offering these $850+ bundles with useless games no one wanted, so I got mine from Walmart for $500. I haven‚Äôt stepped foot in a GameStop in years because they are irrelevant. That‚Äôs not a regurgitated argument, that‚Äôs my opinion based on my experience. 

GameStop could very well survive and run a profitable business if they have success in reimagining their brand, but they would have to DRASTICALLY increase revenue to support a stock price even at $25-30. I think they waited too long to change. They will never be the dominant force in the industry like they were in the mid 00‚Äôs. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been encouraging people to sell. I have no stake in GME, but it makes me sick to see how much money some of you guys have lost. I believe the squeeze is over and I think this sub is full of delusional bag holders that can‚Äôt accept the truth. 

Truthfully, I hope I‚Äôm wrong and GME shoots back up to $500. I want people to win, but I also think it‚Äôs important to look at this situation objectively.",1612856614.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfs22f/why_ill_never_stop_buying_gme_and_why_you/,lipscarf

Anything popular gets turned into a meme though. This time last year DFV was posting incredibly in-depth GME DD and everyone was laughing about it because Gamestop was just the shitty retailer that ripped you off on trade-ins as a kid.

yep, that is what I knew gamestop for.  
bringing in a 100 dollar worth game and geting 3,99 for it.  


but then actually 2 bucks cause the cd was scratched according to the clerk.

and then reselling it 2 hours later for 35 bucks

I agree no one should go into this without tons of research but seriously, think about how freaking childish this sub acts. I get it it's a joke or maybe some sort of cover to not appear culpable as some sort of advice givers but the overall lack of seriousness seemingly... ever (yes I have seen a real post here and there) but it's usually tendies and diamond hands or gay bears and emojis. 

It's a shame this happened. I am sure most will have not read the story but it was an interface error and their shitty support got back to him too late. He thought he owed 760k and ruined his life at only 20. 

Anyway I get it I am not making a joke and am being ""real"" on a joke sub so I will likely be downvoted but I also realize a lot of you are real people who may get it and understand. This sub blew up like 400% this last month and many many many people jumped into this world for the 1st time and a lot of them whether you like it or not off of things read in this sub. 

They are their own person and make their own choices but we have seen all too well how a hive mentality can corrupt.

You misspelled reality. Please spread your naivety somewhere else.

You are in denial mate. Your ""belief in the actual company"" stems from a lack of options. It's the only way to cognitively explain the denial of having made a huge mistake.

Gamestop has dropped steadily for years. Here is the chart: https://i.imgur.com/1ODQ3qJ.png

It would be a miracle if the target price was even above $10. Just sell while it's still at $60. It will drop more today because that report will not show crap.

So, since GME is below $780 per share, there is 100% chance those puts will be executed and he will be forced to buy $156k worth of GME shares. He only received $140k for selling the puts. 

To clear things up, he thought he was going to make money, but unless GME goes to the moon, he is about to be long $ROPE (with a massive loss). And it's because he didn't understand what puts were or how they worked.

People still called him retarded when he got in at $3, and he ‚Äúbag held‚Äù his positions for a long ass time through a dip in March 2020, and he ‚Äúbag held‚Äù it again when it spiked up to $7 and then then down again. People were telling him to sell every time it spiked. The same ‚Äúfundamental investor gurus‚Äù like you were the fucking hivemind that ‚ÄúGME is a bad stock‚Äù and telling DFV to sell. Look up his post history. There are fucking timestamps. 

So you think someone with a $400 GME option is gambling, but someone with $100k in stock and constantly buying the dip to average down isn‚Äôt gambling? If you believed buying option is the only way to gamble, you‚Äôre actually fucking retarded. I have ‚Äúbag held‚Äù through 70% lost with Purple calls and made it back up to break even. Bag holding a position and doubling down IS gambling.

1916,comment,gmoedjt,,"Many claim ""Clean energy"" is usually BS. There is reason we use Nuclear reactor and fissile fuel to generate electricity. All other energy sources severely lack efficiency and cost much more in long run. Some European country who banned nuclear reactor and claimed ""Nuclear Free"" like German ended up import nuclear generated electricity from France. Real clean energy that looks promising is Hydrogen and nuclear fusion energy. There is significant lack of technology to really generate energy from Nuclear fusion, so we are using Fossil Fuel. Don't let media and others fool you. Look into it. Anyone with decent physics background can tell you. solar panel is a garbage energy source and it actually creates more environmental pollution in long-term because it requires **Cadmium** and **Lead** to make solar panel. solar panel's life is quiet short and it is quiet expensive to get rid of it because of Lead and Cadmium. To create solar battery energy require amount is ridiculous since, it require you to use 10 years worth of energy that you can use from that 1 battery. Is it really environmental friendly? I don't think so. Is it clean energy? yes only when you use it. Aftermath is different story. Only clean energy we have right now is electricity generated by nuclear reactor. However, it has problem of radiation and possible explosion (Which I think has quiet low possibility when government regulate properly unlike Japan and Soviet Union) and we don't know how to clean up the waste materiel created from nuclear reactor. Possible upside is that if we can somehow make nuclear fusion possible to generate enough energy efficiently for industrial use, then we probably have enough technology to recycle the waste material created from use of nuclear reactor that is full of radiation.

In that perspective OP's post including Hydrogen and Nuclear which I can tell he really thoughtfully think through his picks. I agree with OPs post.

If I didn't bet on GME and my money aren't tied up on it, then I would have put my money on $FCEL for Hydrogen and $NXE for Nuclear.

1951,comment,gmoehfe,,"Posted elsewhere but what part of they literally didn‚Äôt have money don‚Äôt you understand? When you buy stock there‚Äôs a two day settlement time period(T+2) for the clearing house to clear the transaction.

Stock was super volatile. Clearing house raised their collateral requirements significantly. Robinhood literally didn‚Äôt have the money to front them the cash.

Whether or not you pay in cash doesn‚Äôt matter since Robinhood fronts the money you paid, like I mentioned, there‚Äôs a 2 day settlement period.

How the fuck are they going to front your purchase when they literally have no money? They can‚Äôt use your money. The clearing house requested $3b in collateral, which is why Robinhood received a $3b cash infusion. How do you not understand this? 

If there was an instant settlement period, or even a 1 day settlement period, there wouldn‚Äôt have been issues. 

When stock is not volatile, clearing houses normally only request a small % as margin, which is why brokerages don‚Äôt have issues. If you don‚Äôt want to run into this issue, you should be using a brokerage that manages trillions in wealth and serves as their own clearing house.

As an example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre broke, if I tell you to go to the store and buy me a drink that cost $10 and that I‚Äôll pay you in two days, what are you supposed to do? The store requires you to have the money and pay then and there. Hmm. Maybe get a cash infusion so that you can afford to get me the drink up until I pay you.",1612857859.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,ArcticPros

Even if he only ended up with 500k somehow after everything he could make at least 2% a month (on the safe end. Could definitely make more with some added risk).

Set aside 50k - 80k for a market crash and you can still expect to make at least 8 - 9k a month low risk with just an hour or two of time each week.

Nuclear seems to be a lot more do-able as some countries are already using it as their main source of energy",1612858003.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfehiq/why_clean_energy_is_still_the_high_iq_play_in/,Equinoxbig

> The Last price is the price at which the **last transaction** went through at. When a website provides stock quotes, without providing a Bid or Ask price, the Last price is usually being displayed. The Bid and Ask show what buyers and sellers are willing to reveal about their intention, but the Last price is a truer sense of the current value. For example, I may Bid at $10.50 hoping to collect some shares at that price, but really I am willing to buy up to a price of $10.60. If no one sells to my Bid at $10.50 **I may purchase some shares from a seller at $10.55.

But a call option is going to be a lot cheaper than the stock price because you're not actually buying it yet, you're just saying you might buy it and putting a deposit down for that price. 

This guy put a deposit down about a month ago, for a fraction of that 1200 for 30 call options (3000shares). When gme skyrocketed over the last month, he decided to commit to the rest of that 1200, buying the 3000 shares, and then promptly sold them for 320 each. Making himself a quick million.

Hydrogen, on the other hand, refuels around the same time as diesel and other heavy machinery fossil fuels.

2189,comment,gmof2l3,,"> There‚Äôs no set date they have to cover on. The only factor that dictates when they will cover is the borrowing rate of interest. If it cost less to pay interest for the amount of time they plan on holding their short positions as opposed to covering their shorts at the current market price of course their going to try to wait it out. I didn‚Äôt clarify that shorts ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever have to cover‚Äù because for any real intent or purpose in the real fucking world, that technicality doesn‚Äôt fucking matter.

I think a lot of hype and misinformation on this sub stems from that. It feels that vast majority of people who hopped in on the stock trading memetrain did not know that at all. Initially everyone was convinced the shorts MUST be covered at that fateful Friday, 29th, which was what has driven this sub in an insane frenzy. I didn't knew myself, even though I was reading everything I could, trying to grasp the fundamentals. Information that shorts can be ""extended"" by paying interest, came later. 

I think majority of people here - new people especially, which is a majority now - had never traded stocks before and don't really know how it all works.

> The borrowing rates are low right now but it adds up and they‚Äôre not going to want to shell out tens of millions just to hold a loosing position.

The issue here is that the shares' actual value is hardly even $30 right now, despite what people on reddit are talking about. Despite the new hirings the company is not in a good spot and serious analysts outside of reddit (in as far as I've read, at least, I don't have any subscriptions to in-depth articles) do not really believe it has a future, unless something major happens. I can easily see major institutions holding this for a year, until it just goes under or drops to $5 or less, as it was before the memetrain.",1612858392.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Dragoniel

The next month I was given a raise... but also [super-gross salary](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/09/flash-alert-2020-408.html#:~:text=15%20percent%20rate.-,Background,contributions%20paid%20by%20the%20employer.) was introduced. My payslip was -30EUR lower (I suddenly made 9000 CZK after getting a raise) despite me getting like 20EUR raise.

That one hurt me. Finally it has been abolished this year. I get extra 150-ish EUR now. For 13 years of working I was shorted out of at least 50EUR a month (when I started working full-time it was closer to the 100) by my government with their tax fuckery (which made taxes in general reall convoluted process). The president was extra petty by not signing the decision of the parliament which delayed the abolishment for extra month... made me lose about 13-15k EUR whcih would have really helped me over the 13 years (e.g. getting a mortgage instead of renting would have been attainable).

Retards the lot of them. As are people who buy off-brand vape juice on eBay. With weed vapes in particular the Vitamin E issue was nasty and the cause of most hospitalizations. My cousin had to get 1/3 of one of his lungs removed at age 25. Nasty nasty.

It seemingly showed so much promise and I just bled the entire fucking time and I still don't understand what the fuck the hold up was. It's like the company would just stop moving for long periods of time. Saved most of my christmas/birthday monies to keep averaging down and it just never did anything but sink.

I'm fairly convinced it is some sort of pump and dump target, and I haven't touched the market since this year after that disappointment. I can't believe I randomly stumble upon it here, and finding it's still not bankrupt.

Could be a good buy I'm just saying I'm still salty as fuck.

Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.
>
> Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]

Stay away from Uranium! This market isnt (and cant be) production- or consumption-based. Why? you might ask. Because at any given moment in time some random foreign policy quirk can cause another Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Basically there is a giant stockpile of Uranium, but its bound in nuclear warheads. A stockpile which can be pushed into the market at any given moment. It just takes either a US President planning to win a nobel peace price or Putin getting a stroke and being replaced by a guy who wants to play ""the new kind of Russian leader"" and suddenly the market gets flooded with masses of Uranium everyone wants to get rid off at a bargain price.

And you are in no position to beat the insider knowledge of people being involved in planning/pushing/negotiating those events.

2696,comment,gmoghc6,,"Say oranges cost $1 each, but I expect that to go up.

I go over to my friend Tom, and pay him $5 for a little pink ticket. This pink ticket comes with the promise that if I want to, I can buy a box of 100 oranges for $100 from him at the end of the month.

Now I have three choices:

1) I can wait until the end of the month and pay $100 for the 100 oranges. If oranges now cost $1.07 each, I receive $107 in oranges for just $100 (+$5 for the pink ticket) - I make profit! If oranges cost $1.03, I receive $103 in oranges for just $100, but because of the ticket costing $5, I lose money (but not the full $5)

2) I can wait until the end of the month, and not buy any oranges. Since the the pink ticket is just a permission slip, it‚Äôs not forcing me to buy anything. If the price of oranges goes down, I don‚Äôt lose any money in oranges - I only lose the $5 I spent on the pink ticket

3) I can sell my pink ticket on. Say the price of oranges climbs to $1.20 each, and my friend Jerry thinks it will keep on climbing. He wants to take advantage of this ‚Äòpink ticket‚Äô deal, so he comes over to me and buys my pink ticket for $6 - profit for me! This is obviously a small profit compared to waiting until the end of the month, but if I think oranges are about to become very cheap, I don‚Äôt want to hold on to that ticket and hit losses!

This is how calls work in essence - you pay a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô - the price of the ‚Äòoptions contract‚Äô (pink ticket) for the option to buy 100 shares (oranges), and then either hold your call until the end of the month and ‚Äòtake delivery‚Äô (buy the 100 oranges from Tom) or sell the contract for small profits.

The advantage of calls is that your losses are capped - you can never lose more than the price of the contract. The disadvantage of calls is that the price needs to rise enough to cover the cost of the contract before you make profit. If you pay $5 for the contract, you need the value of 100 bits of stock to rise by more than $5 to make profit.

If you think something is going up but don‚Äôt want to invest too much (you are worried about losses), it‚Äôs a bit safer. Likewise, if the stock is very volatile (goes up and down by big amounts), you can either make a small loss or a big profit, which is pretty good - this is why volatile stocks have slightly more expensive call option contracts.",1612859705.0,2,https://i.redd.it/os2t8yayibg61.png,Nasher_JN

2812,comment,gmogs6o,,"Gamestop has been going down steadily the past years. Not just through the pandemy. It *did* go under. It reported losses after losses and the stock price declined steadily.

The hedgefunds didn't cause that. They realized that and shorted GME positions. Which was a logical and correct move. (They just got too greedy, way overdid it and got a heavy slap for it, but that's a different story.)

The point is: Gamestop is a very bad long term invest. There are much more promising one's. Just taking AMZN, MSFT or more risky (what I'm doing currently): CDXS. About everything would make more sense than GME, BB, NOK or AMC... Those are all dead.

What stops you from taking your GME position to something else? Let's be honest: It's that the move means accepting the loss. But whether you accept it or not, it happened and you won't get it back.",1612859993.0,1,https://i.redd.it/78clurt0eeg61.jpg,ArtDistinct200

3066,comment,gmohh20,,">Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?

Yes. Which is why they won't.

People really underestimate what others are capable of.  By that I mean, that other people have rich full lives and complete, complex minds, and are most likely smart enough to have also figured out the thing it took you, a rando outsider, five seconds to figure out. You know, because they have a lot more experience and also get paid to do it.

Stop. Think for 5 minutes. Pretend you're a hedge fund manager. You say to yourself ""Wow the price is $5, great time to cover. If we try to buy all the shares all at once, as fast as possible, the price will spike. Which will cost us way more money than the interest we'll pay while we calmly unwind over a week or two.

HAHA SIKE GONNA DO IT ANYWAY 20 MILLION $GME YOLO BUYBUYBUY!!!""

It's like, I dunno, seeing an airplane and going ""But did they try making it out of steel??? Gosh, how come planes aren't made of steel?? I need to contact Boeing ASAP I could really be on to something! With the sheer brilliance in my coconut I have certainly stumbled onto a hidden secret that will revolutionize aviation as we know it.""

# NO.

I realize I'm coming off hot here. Not to pick on you in particular but there has been such a deluge of these kinds of questions. Just think about it for a minute!

*This is their job. Their literal job.* If us apes can figure out ""fast buy stock price go up"" then **of course they also know this**. **Of course they will not take the dumbest possible course of action.**

That said, of course nobody knows for certain what's going to happen. Anything could happen. The probability of it happening is the thing to pay attention to.",1612860647.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfjy25/i_need_some_answers_on_the_gme_squeeze/,happyhappypeelpeel

3213,comment,gmohtie,,"I think you're understating a lot of the issues with hydrogen.

* Where are you filling your fuel cell vehicle? There's like 10 hydrogen stations in the US and they're all in Cali.
* How are you filling your hydrogen tank? Pumping gases is a lot more annoying than plugging in an EV. Plus, if hydrogen leaks, good luck dealing with an invisible odorless cloud of explosive gas.
* How are you getting the hydrogen to the station - massive new pipeline network, retooling every gasoline truck, what?
* How are you storing that hydrogen? It's gonna do its damn best to leak out of whatever you put it in, including by permeating through sealed metal tanks.
* How are you producing that hydrogen, and specifically how are you producing it cheaper than electricity? Don't forget that a fuel cell vehicle probably still needs some batteries anyways.

By contrast, essentially every location already has electricity, charging speeds and energy density are going up by the year, and renewable energy is becoming a bigger part of the grid each year. Plus, we can recycle EV batteries. Hydrogen has basically all the problems of EV, plus a whole host of other issues. There might be a few odd edge cases where hydrogen outperforms, but for the vast majority of cases, the future is EV, not hydrogen.",1612860976.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfehiq/why_clean_energy_is_still_the_high_iq_play_in/,Astrosalad

3607,comment,gmoiw6w,,"In the context of a short squeeze and the irrational exuberance around that, of course there would be bag holders. Someone would eventually be left with over priced shares they bought at the top, hoping it would go higher. Thats the risk of following momentum, eventually the momentum fizzles out. Timing when that happens - that is the critical and most difficult part (how many sold Tesla after the split, only to watch it double in 4 or 5 months). Go into a trade with a plan - OK, I will sell when I reach 20% profit, 50% profit, whatever your goal is, then sell and don't look back on how much you could have made if you held

&#x200B;

With GME, there's been so much fuckery and hoopla that I really don't see a squeeze happening. My read is that regardless of the short interest, and even un-purchasable shares to possibly cover, the HF's will eat the losses of borrowing shares longer than anyone ever expected. There wont be a much needed catalyst, and the company has remained ridiculously silent. No whale is coming to save us. Fidelity dumping 4 million shares is not a good sign (seems like 4M of their 9.5M shares).  

&#x200B;

Furthermore, in regards to a squeeze, I really believe the SEC would step in and halt trading for 30 days before the stock were to reach the stratosphere ($600/700) - we saw the degrossing that took place with the gamma squeeze (shorts had to sell long positions in other equities to raise capital to go out and buy GME shares on the open market to cover). This brought the overall market down, which was an ""oh shit"" moment - like holy fuck, how could one stock cause this domino effect.

&#x200B;

However... I do believe in the potential growth of the company (moving to digital distribution, making a few strategic acquisitions, e-sports growth opportunities, gaming hubs, etc). I've been buying since it was in the teens, sold some when it was up in the 250-ish range to cover my initial investment, and I'll buy more on the dips. 

&#x200B;

I have faith in the Chewy dude, but its a longer term play and its going to take some time for a real transformation to a digital business to occur (18-36 months).

Qualcomm is extremely important to San Diego as I believe it‚Äôs the cities only Fortune 500 company. Qualcomm has also had its fair share of struggles lately. I don‚Äôt know if you remember, but had it not been for an order from Trump, the company would‚Äôve been sold to Broadcom. Recently, there is much speculation that Apple and other big smart phone manufacturers are going to completely stop doing business with Qualcomm and push them out of the market and create their own chips instead. Idk how much of Qualcomm‚Äôs business is microchips, but I know it‚Äôs an important part. I‚Äôve also heard several bad things about Qualcomm‚Äôs work environment in the past but it‚Äôs my understanding those complaints aren‚Äôt as frequent anymore. A lot of this type of speculation is similar to the speculation that originally existed around the Apple car. Obviously, now the Apple car is confirmed, but it was kinda obvious for a while for a lot of people in the engineering community that Apple was tryna get into the car business based off of the types of engineers that they were hiding from Universities around the country. Engineering schools that often 
feed into GM and Ford. Now that has nothing to do with Qualcomm, but I‚Äôm trying to give you and idea of where this type of speculation is coming from.

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‚Äò08 ‚Äò09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He‚Äôs working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his ‚ÄúBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment‚Äù which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it‚Äôs truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ‚Äú..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn‚Äôt even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

3949,submission,lff0y0,A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.,"A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

‚ÄúSO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!‚Äù

‚ÄúYEEAHHH!‚Äù -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",1612800487.0,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,ferrellhamster

3951,submission,lffnz6,February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,"February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change.

Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.

This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price.

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side

3969,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",1612808588.0,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,Kwahn

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

3971,submission,lfiug0,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

3972,submission,lfix74,Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options,"Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options  

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.

1. FlowAlgo[ https://flowalgo.com/](https://flowalgo.com/)
2. TitanFlow[ https://titanflow.io/](https://titanflow.io/)
3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data.

3973,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard).

3976,submission,lfjy25,I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.,"I need some answers on the GME Squeeze. Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please.

3983,submission,lfla1i,Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood,"Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",1612816881.0,0.28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,watershoe

3985,submission,lflob4,The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1612818701.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/,Hanshee

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

Is it really that hard to believe a brokerage with this kind of history simply fucked up, and Vlad didn't want to admit to it on tv?",1612825910.0,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfom6m/we_dont_actually_know_whether_or_not_the_rules/,ZeusThunder369

4008,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer
4009,submission,lfpzz9,QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,"QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock. A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",1612830005.0,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,darkside_of_the_tomb

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",1612831034.0,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,Natural_Profession_8

&#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

**$SKLZ Comparison To Upcoming US Esports Streaming Platform**

Visit their website for the love of your unborn child [https://www.skillz.com/](https://www.skillz.com/)

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

4017,submission,lfs22f,"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed.

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor)

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

4038,submission,lfxux0,Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion) I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail.

All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.

I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not to anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

Everyone take a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market. He's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we have people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.

4069,comment,gmol26c,,"If you can find the DD that says that, I'd love the opportunity to read it myself.

That said, I don't think 900 in 365 days is realistic given the potential scope of the pivot and restructuring. The operation itself takes time and I think it's more realistic to expect those numbers *years* in the future rather than in a single year. GME under Ryan Cohen's direction is likely a long term play.

I believe their pivot is going to be a serious effort to emulate Amazon and essentially make a Netflix-like transition from physical goods to a more multi-revenue digital service. Their core business (buying/selling new and used games + consoles) is relatively safe for the next 15 years because of the weak global internet infrastructure (large areas have shitty internet speeds) and shitty ISP practices (like Comcast datacaps) preventing Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo from making all of their consoles digital only. Until they find a way to lower game sizes (unlikely given the sizes needed for next gen visuals) and max out internal storage to multiple terabytes at an affordable price, digital only consoles will remain niche. 

Updating their website isn't a pivot, but they'll undoubtedly polish all of the gamestop global websites and focus on optimizing their delivery services. If they're smart, they will look at the Gamestop locations and how they relate to ISP Fiber Optic availability, close or consolidate weaker stores in those areas and focus on purchasing buildings and setting up shop in areas with fiber-poor areas that are more reliant on physical disks. They could even negotiate with local ISP to get a preferential fiber connection installed and operate a ""free game updates"" kiosk where local kids can come to get their games updated fast.

But I think the key thing telegraphed by the new hires is that one of them spent a year working at Amazon Web Services. I believe that turnover from AWS will likely lead to key new hires to set up a competing digital service for hosting websites, VPNs, etc. They can then use the profits that come from that to subsidize their own streaming service to go toe to toe with Twitch and, eventually, Youtube. There's a lot of discontent among content creators on both platforms and viewers are also growing tired with Amazon and Youtube's bullshit in a lot of respects. Their interest in the local esports scene has me thinking that they'll learn from Mixer's mistakes and avoid paying for exclusive contracts with talent to drive conversion, instead likely opting for cash cup tournaments that require streaming on the platform to qualify with added incentives for attracting a big enough audience to watch. This would entice new and old streamers to join and give an opportunity to allow the new streamers to build their own platform as well. Couple that with aggressive affiliate marketing compensation for promoting Gamestop products and digital services? Perfect position to capitalize on the brand awareness and goodwill to diversify and make themselves an online retailer that also has an entertainment arm. They could even expand beyond gaming similar to twitch and capitalize on the youtube content creators who are upset with the lack of monetization options for content that would be popular and monetizable on cable.

In my eyes, this is a 5-10 year strategy depending on how fast they can go about setting up these services.",1612864190.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff3g1/something_i_noticed_people_have_confused_about/,Sempere

If you're truly worried about losing your back, pare down your positions or buy protective puts (which is what they're for in the first place). If you believe a spike will happen, but more than a week out, and have >100 shares, you can sell a covered call and buy a put with the premiums you got.

Keep in mind that IV may continuously drop. This can cancel out options profit even if the underlying moves in the right direction.

4336,comment,gmolkc0,,"So there's actually a number of things going on in these instances. The first is going against the grain of typical social convention and courtship.  Historically, suitors approach and court women. This is deeply ingrained in many if not all cultures.  This conditioning doesn't disappear online.  This is not to say it doesn't happen the other way.  So, with this role reversal there's a social awkwardness which puts females in a different context; this usually results in a simple hi or equally noncommittal / casual acknowledgement. Double standard, I know.  Bumble includes the option for women to allow men to make first contact to support this social aspect.  Shit messages also are a result of burnout from endless rotations of getting into dead end conversations. The ""Hi"" or equivalent simplistic message is an invitation to take your role back as the chaser and wow them.  But believe it or not, these shitty messages get the highest reply rates prominently because the other person likes the cut of your jib more than your message - generally speaking. I'm over simplifying it but you get the idea.  

The primary reason for no replies is the fact that most sought after people (men and women) are overwhelmed and inundated with too much attention and are almost always balancing one or more prospects to see how they go before moving on. These honeypots that get a massive amount of attention (this can adversely impact an important metric for growth known as distinct first contacts - I.e. how many unique individuals are getting attention).  It's important many people get as many messages to feel included.  Think why scammers pick hot profile pics of girls. Men will flock because they lead with the cock. 

To support distinct first contacts, your stack is manipulated in a number of ways.  Usually, you get the most attractive at the top of your stack to get you hooked. Then you get other people sprinkled in that range from proximity, age, interests, last online time and paid members or boosted members. It's a lot more complicated than that but you get the direction.

With people that get overwhelmed with too many inbound messages, you inevitably get into the territory of bad behaviour such as ghosting, bread-crumbing and so forth.  Alas, the largest issue (for everybody that is) is the paradox of choice. Humans are inherently bad at making a choice when there are too many options. Online dating is no different in this regard.  The fact the grass could always be greener means people find it more difficult than ever to commit to getting to know people in a more meaningful well (hence the 3rd rebranding of Hinge for ""slow dating""). Hinge has been around since 2012 iirc.  They are anti-swipe and limit your actions as a free user. 

I'm not sure if you were eluding to Bumble cornering the user to sub or buy microtransactions triggered by a fraudulent transactions.  This is a major no-no.  No company that's publicly traded would ever use nefarious means to get subs (private companies, well yes they do this lol - Badoo lol. Any type of fraud actually pads the wallets of some of these companies and continue to do so).  Match.com was under fire for this not too long ago.  If there is a notable amount of revenue that's coming from fraud (whether it's you or you're getting benefits from scammers unwittingly) and it's being reported as part of the companies' performance....  that's some serious shit right there.  That's some class action shit right there and likely fines. I think match may have paid a fine for this already. Can't remember. POF was and continues to be in this category.


Anyway, with this retard context, hopefully it gives a bit more insight.",1612864699.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfodyl/why_is_no_one_talking_bmbl_ipo_this_week_bumble/,inphra

4465,comment,gmolu9b,,"Yo, guys, I'd like to ask a question about short-selling as I started reading about it today.

As I understand, short-selling is when you borrow some shares, instantly sell then for market value and then after a certain time you buy them back (hopefully at a lower price), and you return them back to the lender.

Now this ""certain time"" - is it defined when you borrow shares? Like does it say ""You have to return these shares back in 10 days"" or something ?

As far as I read on the internet, it's not defined, so you can return those shares when you want/can, right?

Then why didn't that Melvin Hedge Fund just didn't wait longer on those GameStop shares until the price would fall back down?

I'm sure I'm missing something, maybe someone in the comments can help me understand better how short-selling works.",1612864971.0,-3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf9rdy/gme_megathread_for_mon_28/,PusheenMaster

4506,comment,gmolxr5,,"I think so, yes. Their new CEO can only help.

And, them not going with TSMC (like AMD) spooked investors, but it's actually a smart play. This way, they will remain the only US-based semiconductor producer, while AMD will be at the mercy of Taiwanese manufacturing. They can continue being the innovators, and completely own that innovation. 

AMD made some big moves this year, and they are doing a great job, but Intel is playing the long-game by keeping their development and manufacturing in-house. They didn't panic and offshore to another company when they got leap-frogged by AMD and TSMC. 

They are also making smart investments across the tech industry, and in typical Intel fashion, they're shifting into future technologies and will likely dominate in many sectors moving forward.

I know Intel fucked up bigly under their past CEO, but I think anyone writing off Intel because one bad CEO allowed them to lag behind AMD in consumer processors is straight up delusional.

4538,submission,lffnz6,February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,"February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$BPMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BPMC) Pralsetinib (metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change.

So a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and [lost it all in 4 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/). Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.

This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime  
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail  
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail  
Two days later in municipal court  
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork  
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge  
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge  
Bailiff came over to turn him in  
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin  
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi  
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi  
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her  
Both up state for attempted murder

4556,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",1612808588.0,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,Kwahn

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

4558,submission,lfiug0,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

4559,submission,lfix74,Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options,"Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options  

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.

1. FlowAlgo[ https://flowalgo.com/](https://flowalgo.com/)
2. TitanFlow[ https://titanflow.io/](https://titanflow.io/)
3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. Hope this helps.",1612810757.0,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfix74/boring_but_useful_information_for_new_traders/,utubewhitmantrading
4560,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

Is it algorithms?

Is it a cabal of augurs sifting through offal?

All resources that I've found say that no one has any idea wtf is going on behind the scenes, that it's completely opaque. Sus af.

Lots of people on this forum in recent arguments with me insist it is all above board and totally legit but I can't find whatever information they've found that seems to back up their perspectives.

4563,submission,lfjy25,I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.,"I need some answers on the GME Squeeze. Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please. I need people who actually know what they are talking about... not speculation of ""the squeeze already happened"" or the other side of ""it's going to the moon""",1612813416.0,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfjy25/i_need_some_answers_on_the_gme_squeeze/,SultspartaLoL96

I know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today.

He tried this on other outlets but was always told ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too risky‚Äù ‚Äúmost stock pickers underperform‚Äù ‚Äúyou are better off buying index funds‚Äù. The thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.

We take big risks here, but again, we know they‚Äôre risky and we know what we should be doing‚Äî in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.

I genuinely encourage all new members to come back after you‚Äôve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. Almost anyone can make money buying index funds. It might not be huge money, but it‚Äôs how most people are able to retire these days. 

Most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. Most options expire worthless (theta gang).

4570,submission,lfla1i,Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood,"Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",1612816881.0,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,watershoe

4572,submission,lflob4,The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares.

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too.

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1612818701.0,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/,Hanshee

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor.

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

4595,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer
4596,submission,lfpzz9,QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,"QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock. A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",1612830005.0,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,darkside_of_the_tomb

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",1612831034.0,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,Natural_Profession_8

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

**$SKLZ Comparison To Upcoming US Esports Streaming Platform**

Visit their website for the love of your unborn child [https://www.skillz.com/](https://www.skillz.com/)

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

Revenue **162.39M**

Gross Profit **153.59M**

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

4604,submission,lfs22f,"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  ‚Äúshocking rules"" ‚Äî rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

4607,submission,lftq2y,I believe Qualcomm will recover,"I believe Qualcomm will recover This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

4608,submission,lfttp8,FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,"FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16 Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

I've done some research, and watched it trend. Personally I think it ultimately comes down  to their future in the aerospace industry. Currently I think they are undervalued because of efficiency issues with engines for the f-130.  

but at the end of the day they're still an engineering company that has a history of getting it right in the long term, so I see this play as a mid to long term and getting out around $6-$7.

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor)

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

4625,submission,lfxux0,Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion) I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.

I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not to anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

Everyone take a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

Doing this, notices since Jun 2020, every time there‚Äôs a settlement date, the price ‚Äúgoes the fuck up‚Äù. The downturns only happen between the 2 settlement dates.

4721,comment,gmommx4,,">Pick the brokerage with the strongest balance sheet. What ruined it on RH is that they didnt have enough cash to deal with the growth in accounts, margin loans and volatility. The EXACT SAME THING will happen at the next broker if you dont make sure they have a MULTI-TRILLION dollar balance sheet to be able to handle these kind of circumstances

And there will be class action suits. And they will be combined and they will win and you will get a check for less than $10

I'd have another one regarding short-selling in general.

Why doesn't the price of a stock go up when someone short-sells a stock?

If I understand correctly, the price of a stock rises if it is being bought, right? So when Melvin borrowed a lot of Gamestop shares and sold them, shouldn't the price rise in that case? Cause someone actually bought those shares from Melvin.

5039,comment,gmoney4,,"Sorry but this is not entirely correct. Let's start with basics. Why are shorts short? They are short because they perceive that the company they are shorting is a dud. Thus if you want to do a short squeeze you better understand if this company is a dud, or actually is unfairly shorted.   


So if you figured that out, then yes buy the shares to force a squeeze, but don't keep buying and holding the line. Buy enough to start the process and then when you made your money get out (if dud company). Or  if decent company keep the shares and hedge your gains so that you profit either way.",1612866530.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfwkt0/short_squeezing_for_dummies/,slashinvestor

Your max loss is ~$6,000 if the stock goes to zero, and your max profit is ~$70K if the stock is above $780, and break even is around $60. Realistically though, in 4 days the price is unlikely to fall below $30, so I'd say what you're really risking is $3,000. What you'd essentially done is the same thing as buying a $31 call, except with the call the upside isn't capped:

Normally I'd say a risk profile like this is worth it, but with GME it's too hard to tell. We could find out today that the shorts have covered and the float is below 50%, and the price tanks. Or we could find out it was all a ruse, the float is still >100%, and the price rockets up.

5197,comment,gmons5q,,"I believe the interest is related to the price of the share. So when the price rose to a huge amount, it gets very very expensive for them not to close?

Say you've shorted 1m GME shares at 5$, expecting the company to go bankrupt so you could take home a nice $5m profit. The interest on your short is 1% of the current value a day (totally made up figure, no idea how it actually works), so you'd expect to be paying $50k interest a day, going down as the price drops.

If the shares goes up to $30 like it did, You're 50k interest is now 300k interest. If you wait 17 days, it's cost you more than the 5m you wanted to make. If it goes up to $400 a share you're paying 4m of interest a day, instead of you're expected 50k.

I'm sure it's more complicated than that, not actually sure how the interest is calculated.",1612866894.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf9rdy/gme_megathread_for_mon_28/,A-Grey-World

It also may have something to do with your account. Mine was started at Scottrade over 20 years ago, which Ameritrade bought a few years ago. I do not have margin, and it is also an IRA.

5267,comment,gmonywf,,"The rings in general, but especially the One Ring, exploit the desires of those who wear them. Humans crave power and longevity, thus they become Ring-wraiths. Dwarves crave wealth, which threw a monkey wrench in Sauron's plans, since they locked themselves away rather than creating kingdoms that would eventually serve Sauron. Elves and the wizards crave power also, but in a more refined way. Gandalf would've been scary af with the One Ring, but we don't really get a picture of what he would do other than beat the shit out of Sauron. Galadriel though, damn she would become a whole new level of scary af. Her greatest desire was to maintain the timeless beauty of her small realm, so she would've become the Dark Queen of Middle Earth, and would destroy everything in order to restore the natural order of things.

Hobbits ftw though, even Gollum as long as he was exposed to the One Ring, only wanted it and solitude. Hobbits don't care for power or authority, and they don't really care for wealth. They even resist the temptation of longevity for the most part. They want good food, peace and quiet, and the occasional bit of adventure. The One Ring calls to Bilbo, but even though he is under its thrall to an extent, he really only uses it to troll people. Frodo falls to it in the end, but does a hell of a job for most of the story. Sam doesn't even fucking flinch at the Ring's compulsion, just hands it back to Frodo like it's no big deal.

Hobbits baby, they just wanna drink their ale, smoke their pipes, and not be fucked with. Perfect Ring-bearers.",1612867079.0,1,https://v.redd.it/8fge2iflwbg61,alephylaxis

5358,comment,gmoo54b,,"Okay bro. The cause of this whole was that GME was shorted over 120% of the available float. Then Ryan Cohen bought \~20% of the float which reduced the float. Also instittutuional investors like Blackrock hold above 5%.

There are only 70M shares. So if a group of retards might buy just 5M shares, there would be a hard increase of demand and the shorts would have to cover as the price is going up and they lose money. This covering makes the price increase even faster.

**At this point, we see that very low volume can cause very high price drops/spikes. This means that there must be very few shares available**. In market with high liquidity (many shares available) the price wont drop mucht at a certain volume. But here we have an illiquid market. This brings me to the conlcusion, that retail own more than we think and that we are close to winning. 

What shorts now want you to think is that everyone is selling. So they take some new shorts to keep the price down. **Every share retail sells will reduce their loss.**

That being said, best strategy for retail is still: **Buy the dip and fucking HOLD**.

&#x200B;

**In addition: Even if Short Interest is down to 50% of the float it doesnt mean they are not fucked. Because I already stated the ""available for trading float"" is much smaller than 51MM shares, if retail HOLD.**

&#x200B;

Your second question: It would be very dump if a company would short another stock over 100% after this.",1612867246.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/levf1j/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_08_2021/,DonPalme

5432,comment,gmoo9pg,,"In hindsight eveything seems obvious but on that Thursday when it was going up, the squeeze was almost inevitable. Being greedy would've been the correct choice. 

I said ""almost"" because there was literally only 1 thing that could stop the squeeze - illegal market manipulation fuckery on a huge scale, and they did exactly that, brokers pulled the plug and they prevented the true squeeze from starting.

Idk where you're getting DFV telling that from, he said almost nothing on wsb and most of his videos were focused more on fundamentals than squeeze play.
But still, it's true they had to cover and that would've started the squeeze if not for brokers restricting buying (AND ALLOWING SELLING) that led loss of the entire momentum that was impossible to recover because the buying restrictions were is place for quite some time.

They most likely closed their most at risk positions on Thursday/Friday (obviously not all of them, even if S3 data is correct, you can easily argue it's fishy, 50% short interest would still make GME one of the most shorted companies on the market)

Tbh I still believe a short squeeze could be possible but to begin it needs a serious fundamental catalyst, most probably some serious developments in Ryan Cohen's plans. Even if Gamestop's short interest isn't as high as it was (more than 100% is absolutely nuts and should be illegal) there is still some positivie potential for the future.",1612867371.0,2,https://v.redd.it/oxbtves3rdg61,thesilentlurk3r

If the new chips have better single-core performance, they can at least win back the hardcore gamers temporarily. But for anyone doing literally any work that benefits from multi-core performance (e.g. video editors, artists, developers, etc.), it just makes more sense to go with AMD.

If you want to make money with GME you need to do this: After you can read the market correctly, feel free to buy a new car or more GME stocks. Either way, the money you gain from option trading is the hedges money, and they are playing you atm, you are not playing them, so please, to make money from them selling puts and collecting the premiums, and becoming bullish after hours to sink cost, **option play them**. Don't get stuck in the sunk cost fallacy and keep buying orders at market value, as that's exactly what they expect you to do, and they have their gun aimed right at your head, if you don't play them back.... People can downvote me all they want, but you will lose if you keep trying to buy stocks at market value and not **option these guys into hell. \*If you see a drop during market hours prepare for a loss in cashflow far further than if it jumped during high volatility and the current p/e.**

6024,comment,gmopmgz,,"""He was a feared gambler, few dared to take him on, so high and audacious were his stakes. He played the game due to a pain of his heart, losing and wasting his wretched money in the game brought him an angry joy, in no other way he could demonstrate his disdain for wealth, the merchants' false god, more clearly and more mockingly.

Thus he gambled with high stakes and mercilessly, hating himself, mocking himself, won thousands, threw away thousands, lost money, lost jewelry, lost a house in the country, won again, lost again. That fear, that terrible and petrifying fear, which he felt while he was rolling the dice, while he was worried about losing high stakes, that fear he loved and sought to always renew it, always increase it, always get it to a slightly higher level, for in this feeling alone he still felt something like happiness, something like an intoxication, something like an elevated form of life in the midst of his saturated, lukewarm, dull life.

And after each big loss, his mind was set on new riches, pursued the trade more zealously, forced his debtors more strictly to pay, because he wanted to continue gambling, he wanted to continue squandering, continue demonstrating his disdain of wealth. Siddhartha lost his calmness when losses occurred, lost his patience when he was not payed on time, lost his kindness towards beggars, lost his disposition for giving away and loaning money to those who petitioned him. He, who gambled away tens of thousands at one roll of the dice and laughed at it, became more strict and more petty in his business, occasionally dreaming at night about money! And whenever he woke up from this ugly spell, whenever he found his face in the mirror at the bedroom's wall to have aged and become more ugly, whenever embarrassment and disgust came over him, he continued fleeing, fleeing into a new game, fleeing into a numbing of his mind brought on by sex, by wine, and from there he fled back into the urge to pile up and obtain possessions. In this pointless cycle he ran, growing tired, growing old, growing ill.""

And I'd recommend learning basic candlestick and chart patterns. Stop Loss when your support level is broken and then buy the dip.

6126,submission,lfh551,The case for VSTO,"The case for VSTO Fellow degenerates, ammo is the next play. Hear me out.

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies. 

TLDR: Ammo sales are exploding (literally), buy the main beneficiary VSTO.",1612806078.0,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfh551/the_case_for_vsto/,DC_Schemin

6130,submission,lfhlp7,DD - Patience is a Virtu,"DD - Patience is a Virtu Well done. Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices.

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime

Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork

6136,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

THIS IS NOT STOCK ADVICE, JUST EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT (maybe lol) AND MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.  

SGMO TLDR 

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

6138,submission,lfiug0,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

Feel free to tell me why I'm stupid.

6139,submission,lfix74,Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options,"Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options  

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.

1. FlowAlgo[ https://flowalgo.com/](https://flowalgo.com/)
2. TitanFlow[ https://titanflow.io/](https://titanflow.io/)
3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. Hope this helps.",1612810757.0,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfix74/boring_but_useful_information_for_new_traders/,utubewhitmantrading
6140,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?

This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",1612816881.0,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,watershoe

After finishing business school i was disapointed at the entire prospect of working in my field (PR and Management) as most entry positions were either complete bullshit or nonexistant. I went to make a career out of my hobby, videoediting. Its been a successful career and ive gotten to a point where im well off enough to be able to throw some money around without risking much. Cue WSB. I had known about this reddit group for some time but didnt really pay much attention, until GME happened. I opened a trading acc and put in 650‚Ç¨ - a measly 1.25 shares... yes yes, i was late as fuck, but hear me out. I lost 85% within no time at all, but while looking at my portfolio every 15 seconds I invested into a bunch of other things like criptic currency and a few other stocks, including OCGN. Well, i got back my losses on GME and then some. And with my business education background i have a basic understanding of how the markets work. Now i can see this as a potential source of additional income for my family and myself. So thank you WSB!!!

All the best to all of you!

6152,submission,lflob4,The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

TL/DR: Understand how digital securities are going to change the securities markets.",1612817931.0,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflob4/the_solution_to_the_robinhood_problem/,DIYjackass

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more **Major Catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too.

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1612818701.0,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/,Hanshee

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

6175,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside.

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

&#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors.

6184,submission,lfs22f,"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  ‚Äúshocking rules"" ‚Äî rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

6187,submission,lftq2y,I believe Qualcomm will recover,"I believe Qualcomm will recover This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

6188,submission,lfttp8,FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,"FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16 Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal. 

Note: I don‚Äôt provide sell points, so don‚Äôt ask.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor)

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

6205,submission,lfxux0,Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion) I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail. It's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics. What does that tell you about how wide-spread this is in the industry? Now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today.

All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

Everyone have a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market. He's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we see people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.

I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.

6208,submission,lfz6ar,Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market',"Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market' Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes.

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.

""TRUFORMA‚Ñ¢ is the company's innovative diagnostic¬†tool¬†that aims to replace old-fashioned methods of diagnosis that require patient samples to be sent to an outside lab for testing before therapeutic or prescription treatments can be offered. And, as most already know, that diagnostic turnaround time can take days or even weeks, which can not only delay urgent treatment but can also lead to additional medical complications. Now, with modern innovations coming to market by companies like Zomedica, a fast, accurate point-of-care diagnosis can be provided right at the clinic.

Ethics aside, their best play RN would be to convince an entire new group of retail investors to surge the stock again so they can exit in the green or at least recoup the majority of their investment.

Lots of people have been sold guarantees in the last 2 weeks and are currently left holding the bag, will it squeeze again? Fuck knows, but I'm personally not betting that it will though i've missed out on plenty of opportunities because of my gut (and saved myself from losing a lot of money).

Is it currently valued too high for it's future? Fuck knows, take sources you trust - some say $90 EOY, others say much less, some say much more. Maybe try and find an average and get in there if you're interesting in holding for awhile.

Theaters are struggling even without a pandemic because everyone is slowly moving towards the streaming market. If you look at The Golden Globes this year, the majority of nominations come from streaming services such as Disney+ or Netflix.

6527,comment,gmore61,,"This is a technical play and I might write up a longer post about it explaining it in simpler ape speak. 

PTON sells convertible notes

https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750

First off, the conversion price of the notes has been set at $240, a 65% upside from current price. Whoever was investing couldn't stop salivating over these and PTON expanded the offering from $600M to $875M + optional $125M. At 0% interest. 

Let me repeat that, institutions are giving PTON a $1B in cash at 0% interest, for the promise of being able to buy PTON shares at $240 within the next 6 years.

Second, and here's the key part:

>the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Peloton's Class A common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. 

I know you all are full from that 64-pack of crayola you had for breakfast and you can barely read right now, so I'll dumb this down. Peloton is buying options on itself, specifically $70M of call options at a strike price of 362.48. 

When you buy calls, whoever sold you the calls is forced to buy shares to offset the delta. So the ""option counterparty"" will be forced to buy a lot of PTON stock, I'm assuming in the range of $100M-$150M of shares. That's about a million shares that will get purchased this week, at whatever price, and they have to be held until 2024 or when the note holders convert.

PTON already has 70% institutional ownership, and even more institutional interest at these elevated prices is super bullish in of itself. The technical play for this week puts a cherry on top. 

If someone who can read a 8-K reads this, yes convertible notes are dilutionary but the call options negates any dilution. PTON basically puts down $1B in the liabilities column and $1B cash in the assets column.",1612870273.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflpoz/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_09_2021/,BA_calls

-Huge margin buy when price was >300

-people gambling student loads

-people gambling money they need

-having family/friends buy in

Even if nothing else happens this was insane. We really brought to the foreground what big money can do to save their ass. A lot of people's lives changed for the better. A lot will be bag holding. Going forward know that anything short term in the market is a gamble. If you think a company will do well, invest. If you think the price will skyrocket tomorrow, then gamble. Just know what you are actually doing.

To be fair, although it was a lot of sobbing and confirmation bias, it wasn't insidious. This is because WSB had no effect on SPY. Now people have realised that we can affect the market, they're actively looking to use WSB to manipulate it. It's actually questionable whether this shit is legal at this point.

What's sad is SI hasn't covered - Finra put an entire year's of bogus data down to a ""software bug"" by the way. You'd know that if you browse new, you find DD about GME. ... but all of them get deleted after an hour or two. Even good ones, not just ""hOlD tHe LiNe ApEs"" bullshit.

What's sad is despite the very genuine potential, it has been completely snubbed by the old mods who likely have directive from admins who likely have directive from agencies to cut this loose. That's not that far fetched a conspiracy.

Theres so much uncertainty and disinformation about this it's unreal. I'm cutting my losses and accepting there's an unreal chance of this bouncing back.

7156,comment,gmosgo1,,"I have few GME and AMC shares that i plan on holding. I dont like AMC as i like GME tho. My reasoning is that i bought them on believing the idea that this stock is heavily shorted and i expect the gains  not from company becoming more profitable but form shorts buying it out. So only reason for me to sell now is that a) squeeze happened and i missed it b) there is new information witch proves that squeeze wont happen.  As i see from DD's posted here I think that initial price rise and spike a week ago was not form shorts covering but from reddit created frenzy witch stoped when apps banned buying this stock and paper hands started selling (even tho DFV did not sell), so as rule stock fell like a rock. So IMO all the gains posted here are just redditors exchanging monney and not Hedge funds picking up the bill. This frenzy and price hike was never part of plant and we can ignore it all together, it was just byproduct -  What I want want is squeeze. So if you bought shares hoping for pump and dump gains you should sell shares and accept loses as there is no evidence such reddit frenzy will happen again (might be wrong if todays numbers show shorted shares 100%+) if you bought in for squeeze you should hold (Buy in price does not matter) as you are still in rocket.",1612871200.0,1,https://v.redd.it/x7coifqlyeg61,Moriartijs

You could hold and cash out annually equivalent to your capital gains tax on any gains you're cashing out on to nullify the loss, that's what I plan to do.  It also keeps you in play in case there is another squeeze.  

It's good motivation to get the DD right and claw back what you 'may' have lost.  (You haven't lost anything until you cash out).",1612871229.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfwkt0/short_squeezing_for_dummies/,NaughtyReplicant

But it all depends on how you set it up and how risky you want to make it. If you sell deep OTM weekly puts that you are fairly confident the stock won't come down to that price, all you have to do is wait until Friday, the contracts become worthless and you keep the credit.

The main thing is what OTM puts your going for, meaning how far OTM or how close to ATM they are (basically risk factor).

7412,submission,lfhlp7,DD - Patience is a Virtu,"DD - Patience is a Virtu Well done. Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices.

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over

7418,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",1612808588.0,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,Kwahn

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

7420,submission,lfiug0,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data.

7422,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

7425,submission,lfjy25,I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.,"I need some answers on the GME Squeeze. Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out? 

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please.

7432,submission,lfla1i,Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood,"Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",1612816881.0,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,watershoe

7434,submission,lflob4,The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more **Major Catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

PS: Fuck **Jim ""Once a Shill Always a Shill"" Cramer**. That Indecisive, Bi-Polar Clown.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too.

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",1612818701.0,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/,Hanshee

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

7447,submission,lfmm2o,You Were Always Going to be Holding the Bags,"You Were Always Going to be Holding the Bags GME buyers were given two amazing gifts.  The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.  We've all held the bags from time to time, and it sucks, but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves.  Oh and the people being critical of you trying to pump GME a second time, the ones you call shills?  Those are usually WSB vets.

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

7457,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer
7458,submission,lfpzz9,QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,"QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock. A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",1612830005.0,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,darkside_of_the_tomb

Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",1612831034.0,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,Natural_Profession_8

# So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

&#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

**$SKLZ Comparison To Upcoming US Esports Streaming Platform**

Visit their website for the love of your unborn child [https://www.skillz.com/](https://www.skillz.com/)

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

Gross Profit **153.59M**

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

7466,submission,lfs22f,"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

7470,submission,lfttp8,FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,"FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16 Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good.

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor)

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

7487,submission,lfxux0,Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion) I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

7489,submission,lfyzh5,Cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview,"Cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview Plenty of you degenerates have seen the interview from 2006 where Jim Cramer talks about about stock manipulation being a ""fun game"" from his hedge fund days. He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail. It's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics. What does that tell you about how wide-spread this is in the industry? Now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today.

All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

Everyone have a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market. He's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we see people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.

I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.

7490,submission,lfz6ar,Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market',"Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market' Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

7491,submission,lfzh7h,GEVO is a great company with lots of upside potential,"GEVO is a great company with lots of upside potential GEVO's co-CEO just won the nobel price in chemistry and guess what, she's also on Biden's science advisory board \[1\]\[2\]. Now what are they actually doing? They're making jet fuel from plants. Jet fuel! Do you realize, this is the only available way to make planes ""clean"" in the foreseeable future? This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes. And it gets even better. They hold a patent on this tech, so only they can do it \[3\].

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.

Also I should mention that you're basically helping the environment by investing in this. You'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.

People don't even have $100 a month to spare, so it's next to impossible to turn that into thousands.

On Friday, the New York Times reported that singer FKA Twigs, 32, is suing actor and director Shia LaBeouf for physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. In an interview with the Times, Twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, alleged that the 34-year-old actor, whom she met on the set of his 2018 film Honey Boy, ‚Äúrelentless[ly]‚Äù abused her, physically and emotionally, knowingly giving her an unidentified sexually transmitted infection, and battered her on numerous occasions. In court documents, she alleges that he stored firearms in the home, strangled her on Valentine‚Äôs Day 2019, forcibly slammed Barnett against his car and then tried to strangle her. She also claimed that on several occasions, he would forcibly squeeze her arm to the point of bruising and that he controlled how many times she touched or kissed him per day, as well as whether she would wear clothes to bed.",1612872577.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfyzh5/cramer_is_working_hard_to_take_down_videos_of_his/,Brilliant_Bet

Stop losses on shares can make sense, but options are a different beast. Some brokerages won't even let you set them on options. 

A simple IV swing could result in you getting stop-loss'd out of an otherwise profitable position, especially on short options. Long options are already defined risk, so they essentially come with a natural stop-loss.

7892,comment,gmouiiw,,"Dear Diary,

It‚Äôs been 14 days since the apes took over our homeland. I tried fighting back against the onslaught at first, but it proved to be in vain as their numbers just kept increasing. They seem to become more aggressive with time, while showing no visible signs of fatigue. 

After a few days, I made an attempt to find shelter and bunker down. I‚Äôve been in hiding for a little over a week now. It seems they‚Äôve worn themselves out. Most have blown up their accounts but they still linger. Their numbers continue to steadily increase despite no signs of long term survival. Fortunately even with the continued increase in volume, they‚Äôre seeming to grow more quiet. 

I woke up early today, in an attempt to assess the damage. They‚Äôre still everywhere. Shrieking something about diamond hand and not selling. There‚Äôs literal shit everywhere. Nothing is sacred of their footprints. I‚Äôm growing weary... afraid. How much longer will I last? I haven‚Äôt made contact with any of my fellow autists in over 2 weeks now. I can only hope they are still out there. 

I‚Äôve heard grumbles of a report coming out this afternoon. I can only hope this will be what finally drives them away, so those of us who are left can finally rise up and reclaim our once vibrant and lively home. 

Ps. If you find this, please delete my browser history.",1612872879.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg0h70/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_09_2021/,dube123

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price.

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card

Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime  
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

I went to get them out but there was no bail  
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail  
Two days later in municipal court  
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork  
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge  
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge  
Bailiff came over to turn him in  
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin  
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi

8100,submission,lfi3va,How to read DD on WSB.,"How to read DD on WSB. So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",1612808588.0,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,Kwahn

THIS IS NOT STOCK ADVICE, JUST EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT (maybe lol) AND MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.  

SGMO TLDR 

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

8102,submission,lfiug0,Extra Dumb Question about AMC,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

Feel free to tell me why I'm stupid.

8103,submission,lfix74,Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options,"Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options  

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.

1. FlowAlgo[ https://flowalgo.com/](https://flowalgo.com/)
2. TitanFlow[ https://titanflow.io/](https://titanflow.io/)
3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it‚Äôs better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow‚Äôs main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. Hope this helps.",1612810757.0,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfix74/boring_but_useful_information_for_new_traders/,utubewhitmantrading
8104,submission,lfj2k0,The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,"The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?   

Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please.

I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

After finishing business school i was disapointed at the entire prospect of working in my field (PR and Management) as most entry positions were either complete bullshit or nonexistant. I went to make a career out of my hobby, videoediting. Its been a successful career and ive gotten to a point where im well off enough to be able to throw some money around without risking much. Cue WSB. I had known about this reddit group for some time but didnt really pay much attention, until GME happened. I opened a trading acc and put in 650‚Ç¨ - a measly 1.25 shares... yes yes, i was late as fuck, but hear me out. I lost 85% within no time at all, but while looking at my portfolio every 15 seconds I invested into a bunch of other things like criptic currency and a few other stocks, including OCGN. Well, i got back my losses on GME and then some. And with my business education background i have a basic understanding of how the markets work. Now i can see this as a potential source of additional income for my family and myself. So thank you WSB!!!

All the best to all of you!

8116,submission,lflob4,The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

TL/DR: Understand how digital securities are going to change the securities markets.",1612817931.0,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflob4/the_solution_to_the_robinhood_problem/,DIYjackass

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more **Major Catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too.

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.  We've all held the bags from time to time, and it sucks, but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves.

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

8139,submission,lfpkl9,"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)","There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc) Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",1612828733.0,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,Whisky-Slayer
8140,submission,lfpzz9,QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,"QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock. A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",1612830005.0,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,darkside_of_the_tomb

Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside.

# So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

&#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke.

8148,submission,lfs22f,"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  ‚Äúshocking rules"" ‚Äî rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

I wanted to include as many pictures in my DDs as you guys have chromosomes so please...

8151,submission,lftq2y,I believe Qualcomm will recover,"I believe Qualcomm will recover This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

8152,submission,lfttp8,FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,"FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16 Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal. 

Note: I don‚Äôt provide sell points, so don‚Äôt ask.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding.

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor)

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

8169,submission,lfxux0,Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion) I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail. It's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics. What does that tell you about how wide-spread this is in the industry? Now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today.

All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

Everyone have a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market. He's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we see people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.

I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.

8172,submission,lfz6ar,Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market',"Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market' Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

Now what are they actually doing? They're making jet fuel from plants. Jet fuel! Do you realize, this is the only available way to make planes ""clean"" in the foreseeable future? This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes. And it gets even better. They hold a patent on this tech, so only they can do it \[3\].

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.

Also I should mention that you're basically helping the environment by investing in this. You'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.
